                Iâ€™m a qualified counsellor providing one-to-one therapy for
                adults over the age of 18. I work face to face in Oxford as well
                as online via Zoom.
              </p>
              <p>
                My approach to counselling is integrative, meaning that I draw
                on a range of therapeutic approaches to best fit your specific
                circumstances and goals.

              Who is counselling for and how does it help?
            </h3>
            <p>
              People come to counselling for all sorts of reasons. I have
              experience working with clients experiencing a range of issues
              including:
            </p>
            <p>
              Counselling provides a safe, empathetic, non-judgemental space to
              explore whatever is going on for you, with a qualified
              professional who can help to guide you through that process.
            </p>
            <p>
              What this looks like in practice is unique to each individual, but
              it may involve exploring the past or a specific incident,
              examining your relationships with others, or working to develop
              greater self-acceptance.

              I also have extensive experience supporting neurodivergent
              individuals and individuals identifying as LGBTQ+, including trans
              and non-binary individuals.
